/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5] 
[0, 1, 3, 5, 6]
number <(n) < the length of citations(arr)>
n elements that's values are greater or equal to n

Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

        if (sorted[i] <= sortedLength - i) {
            return sorted[i]
        }
    }
    return sortedLength
    // for (var i = 0; i < sorted.length; i++) {
    //     let current = sorted[i];
    //     if (sortedLength - i  >= current) {
