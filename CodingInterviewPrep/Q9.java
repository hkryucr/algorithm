Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

{ 
1: ""
2: "abc", 
3: "def", 
4: "ghi", 
5: "jkl", 
6: "mno". 
7: "pqrs", 
8: "tuv", 
9: "wxyz"
0: ""
}

Example:

Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
Note:

23
a b c
d e f 

ad ae af
bd be df
cd ce cf

923

w x y x
a b c
d e f




Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.
